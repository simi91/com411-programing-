#While loop (and also FOR loop) can be used to have a repetition of a procedure in our code

print("How many times to print the symbols?")
n = int(input()) #x=3

#i is a counter - it keeps track of how many times we went throught the loop
i = 0

while i < x:  # condition for repeating the code -  as long as i lower than x
  print("\u27BD")
  i = i + 1 #new value of the counter is one more then it used to be

print("We left the loop")
